**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This repo is inactive and has not been maintained for quite some time. This functionality is now part of the official Tableau software and anyone using this tool should migrate to use the officially supported approach going forward. Additionally, as of March 4, 2022, I am departing my position at Tableau so no future updates or maintenance will be performed on this repo.
